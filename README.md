# Welcome to the Cayenne Docs

## Introduction
I will be walking you through editing content from Cayenne's boutiful Documentation setup. This is a work-in-progress, and collaboration is always encouraged.

## Getting Started
This section will highlight the common actions you might take while editing the docs. The instructions below describe the process using GitHub's built-in web editor.

### Making a minor text edit
Let's say you find something incorrectly written or you would like to update some text. First, you would find the main section the article is located in. 

**We'll use Getting Started for our example:**

1. Navigate to the Home directory of the repo by clicking cayenne-docs at the top of the page.
2. Then, select the docs directory by clicking the link.
3. In that folder, you will see the various high-level sections of the Docs. Select the GETTINGSTARTED.md by clicking it.
4. You will now see a preview of this section. Above the preview, on the grey bar, you will see a pencil icon. Click that to begin editing.
5. Find the portion of text you would like to edit. Make your changes, and then preview them by selecting the eye icon labeled "Preview changes".
6. If you want to add some style, code, or something more specific than text, follow the link to the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for a quick breakdown.
